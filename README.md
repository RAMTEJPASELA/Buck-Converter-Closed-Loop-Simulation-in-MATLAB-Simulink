# âš¡ Operation and Control of a DC-DC Buck Converter Using PID-Based Closed-Loop Regulation in MATLAB Simulink

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  

Building upon the previously developed [**open-loop buck converter model**](https://github.com/RAMTEJPASELA/Buck-Converter-Open-Loop-Simulation-in-MATLAB-Simulink/blob/main/README.md), this project focuses on the implementation of a **closed-loop control system using a PID (Proportionalâ€“Integralâ€“Derivative) controller**. While the open-loop system successfully demonstrated key theoretical concepts such as **inductor volt-second balance**, **capacitor charge balance**, and **small-ripple approximation**, it lacked the ability to regulate output voltage under dynamic conditions such as **load fluctuations** (or) **changes in input supply**.

In practical applications especially in **electric vehicles**, **aerospace systems**, and **renewable energy technologies**â€”maintaining a **stable output voltage** despite external disturbances is critical. Open-loop operation lacks in such cases because it provides **no feedback mechanism** to correct deviations. This motivates the need for a **closed-loop control system**, where real-time output voltage is monitored and compared against a reference. The **PID controller** adjusts the duty cycle accordingly to minimize the error, ensuring accurate and robust voltage regulation.
